## About the Video Course
Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers powerful ways to interpret and act on spoken and written language. It can help you with tasks such as customer support enquiries and customer feedback analysis. As the quantity of data continues to grow at an incomprehensible rate, being able to understand and process data is becoming a key differentiator for competitive organizations.

This course will help you gain this skill by practical demonstrations, clear explanations, and interesting real-world examples. It will give you a versatile range of deep learning and NLP skills that you can put to work in your own applications. 

By the end of this tutorial, you’ll have a better understanding of NLP and will be able to transform data into actionable knowledge. You will also have worked on multiple examples that implement deep learning to solve real-world spoken-language problems.
